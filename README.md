# Leaflet-challenge

**Overview:**

Within this assignment, I learned how to use Javascript in retreiving data and posting it to a map to recall information within the Json objects; as listed below:

**Objectives:**
* <ins>Create the Earthquake Visualization:</ins> <br>
  * Select the dataset- I chose the 4.5+ scale for the last week.
  * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
  * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
  * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
  * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

**<ins> Special Thanks to Caleb Steeves: </ins>** <br>
With helping me understand how the legend fits into the HTML, with difference from class example.
